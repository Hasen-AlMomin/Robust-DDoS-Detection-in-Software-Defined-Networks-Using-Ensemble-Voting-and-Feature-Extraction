# Robust DDoS Detection in Software Defined Networks using Ensemble Voting and Feature Extraction

## Project Description
This project provides a framework for **DDoS detection** using **Ensemble Voting** in a **Software Defined Network (SDN)**. The network is implemented using **Mininet** and controlled by **RYU**. The detection system leverages a hybrid of classification algorithms to identify DDoS attacks.

# Robust-DDoS-Detection-in-Software-Defined-Networks-Using-Ensemble-Voting-and-Feature-Extraction
his project aims to provide a basic framework for DDoS mitigation using Deep reinforcement learning. The network is implemented using Mininet (based on Software defined networking).

The design of the solution is inspired by the work Robust DDoS Detection in Software-Defined Networks Using Ensemble Voting and Feature Extraction" by Hasen AlMomin, Amir Gargouri and Mohamed Ali Ghorbel.

Robust DDoS Detection in Software Defined Networks using Ensemble Voting and Feature Extraction
Project Description
This project provides a framework for DDoS detection using Ensemble Voting in a Software Defined Network (SDN). The network is implemented using Mininet and controlled by RYU. The detection system leverages a hybrid of classification algorithms to identify DDoS attacks.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

1. Install Ubuntu OS
Ensure you are running Ubuntu 20.04 or later. This guide assumes you are using Ubuntu.

2. Install Mininet, OpenVSwitch, and Ryu
To run the SDN network with the Ryu controller and Mininet, follow these steps:

Install Mininet
bash
Copy
sudo apt-get install mininet
Install OpenVSwitch
bash
Copy
sudo apt-get install openvswitch-switch
Install Ryu SDN Controller
bash
Copy
sudo apt-get install python3-ryu
3. Install Python and Dependencies
Ensure Python 3.x and pip are installed. Then, install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
pip install numpy scikit-learn pandas matplotlib
Running the SDN Environment
Step 1: Run the Ryu Controller
Navigate to the directory where your Ryu controller application (app1.py) is located and run it using the following command:

bash
Copy
cd /path/to/your/ryu/app/
ryu-manager app1.py
This starts the Ryu controller to manage the SDN.

Step 2: Run the Network Topology
In another terminal, navigate to the directory containing the topo5.py file and run the network topology in Mininet:

bash
Copy
cd /path/to/your/mininet/topo/
sudo python3 topo5.py
This will create the SDN topology as defined in topo5.py.

Step 3: Test the Environment (DDoS Attack Simulation)
You can simulate a DDoS attack using Hping3. First, ensure you have Hping3 installed:

bash
Copy
sudo apt-get install hping3
Then, run the DDoS attack with the following command:

bash
Copy
sudo hping3 --flood -p 80 <target-ip>
Replace <target-ip> with the IP address of the target machine in your network.

Step 4: Running the Detection Algorithms
After running the network and simulating the DDoS attack, you can execute the detection algorithms to evaluate the DDoS detection performance.

Run the Hybrid Algorithm Accuracy Score
bash
Copy
python accuracy_score_Hybrid.py
Generate the Confusion Matrix
bash
Copy
python confusion_matrix.py
Evaluate the Detection Rate
bash
Copy
python detection_rate.py
These scripts will analyze the attack and evaluate the detection system's performance.

Notes for Reproducibility
1. Dependencies
To ensure all dependencies are installed, consider creating a requirements.txt file with all necessary Python libraries. You can generate this by running:

bash
Copy
pip freeze > requirements.txt
2. Data and Results
If your project uses specific datasets, include them in your repository or provide links to access them. If the dataset is generated dynamically, mention the method to generate it.

3. Environment Setup
To make it easier for others to set up the same environment, consider including a Dockerfile or instructions for creating a virtual environment with all dependencies.
